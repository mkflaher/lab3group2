PIN	Description
VDD	Regulated 3.3 V output. Almost 150 mA is available to power external components. (If you want to bypass the internal regulator, you can instead use this pin as a 3.3 V input with VIN disconnected.)
VIN	This is the main 2.5 V to 5.5 V power supply connection. The SCL/SPC and SDA/SDI level shifters pull the I²C and SPI bus high bits up to this level.
GND	The ground (0 V) connection for your power supply. Your I²C or SPI control source must also share a common ground with this board.
SDA/SDI/SDO	Level-shifted I²C data line and SPI data in line (also doubles as SDO in 3-wire mode): HIGH is VIN, LOW is 0 V
SCL/SPC	Level-shifted I²C/SPI clock line: HIGH is VIN, LOW is 0 V
SDO/SA1	SPI data out line in 4-wire mode: HIGH is VDD, LOW is 0 V. This output is not level-shifted. Also used as an input to determine I²C slave address (see below).
CS	SPI enable (chip select). Pulled up to VDD to enable I²C communication by default; drive low to begin SPI communication.
DRDY	Data ready indicator, a 3.3-V-logic-level output. HIGH (3.3 V) indicates magnetic data can be read. This output is not level-shifted.
INT	Programmable interrupt, a 3.3-V-logic-level output. This output is not level-shifted.

The serial interface interacts with the application through 4 wires: 
	1. CS - serial port enable
	2. SPC - clock
	3. SDI  - input
	4. SDO - output

Use 4 wire mode

Read
	1. CS low
	2. SDI = (RW=1)+ (MS=1)+(AD = ) //from Master (Msp430)
		a. RW = 1 //read
		b. MS = 1 //auto increment
		c. AD = //address of the register on the slave
			i. OUT_X_L (28h), OUT_X_H(29h)
			ii. OUT_Y_L(2Ah), OUT_Y_H(2Bh)
	3. SDO = data that will be read from the device (magnetometer -> MSP430)
		a. can be 2 bytes if 

		
		

Magnetic data
The magnetic data is expressed with two registers for each of the X, Y, and Z directions. Concatenate OUT_X_H and OUT_X_L to get a two's complement number. Default is little endian.  

Earth's magnetic field is 0.65 gauss. Sensor's noise level is 5 miligauss
